I'll give you a complete step-by-step guide for setting up the GitHub token and deploying it to both Vercel and Netlify:

## Getting GitHub Token
1. Click your profile picture → Settings
2. Scroll down to "Developer settings" (at the bottom of the left sidebar)
3. Click "Personal access tokens" → "Tokens (classic)"
4. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
5. Fill in the token details:
   - Note: "Docs Feedback Token"
   - Expiration: Choose your preferred duration
   - Select these permissions:
     - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
     - `write:discussion` (Create and edit discussions)
6. Click "Generate token"

## Setting up in Vercel
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Click "Settings" tab
4. Click "Environment Variables" in the left sidebar
5. Add new variable:
   - Name: `GITHUB_TOKEN`
   - Value: Paste your GitHub token
   - Environment: Select "Production" (and "Preview" if needed)
6. Click "Save"
7. Go to "Deployments" tab
8. Click "Redeploy" on your latest deployment

## Setting up in Netlify
1. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Select your site
3. Go to "Site settings"
4. Click "Environment variables" in the left sidebar
5. Click "Add a variable":

6. Click "Save"
7. Go to "Deploys" tab
8. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"


## Important Notes
- Keep your GitHub token secure and never commit it to your repository
- If you need to use the token in development, create a `.env.local` file:
  ```
  GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
  ```
- If you ever need to revoke the token:
  1. Go back to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
  2. Find your token
  3. Click "Delete" and confirm
